# Right-Whale-Recognition
Final Project for EECS445

For the newbies of git, please read https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/copy-your-git-repository-and-add-files-746520876.html
for basic use of git.

I will upload more useful material to this repo. I would suggest to start your mini project earlier to get a sense of what is convolutional neural network and how it work, which we will use for our project.
